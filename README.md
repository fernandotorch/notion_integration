## Notion Automations

Sample code using Notion API to programatically read and write information to our databases

# Setup

To get started, it is necessary to add a config.yaml file to the .config folder. This must include the property "NOTION_KEY", including the value of the integration API key (See https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization for more information).

Then you can run notion_connect.py for running the examples

# Where to go next

Further information about the API use can be found in https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro. Check the "Endpoints" section for how to create, update and read pages and databases, as well as "Objects" for how to explore the fields within pages and databases.
